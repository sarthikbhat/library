       <h1 class="text-center">This Is Management System</h1>
       <p>A management system is a set of policies, processes and procedures used by an organization to ensure that it can fulfill the tasks required to achieve its objectives. <br> These objectives cover many aspects of the organization's operations (including financial success, safe operation, product quality, client relationships, legislative and regulatory conformance and worker management). <br> For instance, an environmental management system enables organizations to improve their environmental performance and an occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS) enables an organization to control its occupational health and safety risks, etc.

         <br>   Many parts of the management system are common to a range of objectives, but others may be more specific. <br>
            
            A simplification of the main aspects of a management system is the 4-element "Plan, Do, Check, Act" approach. <br> A complete management system covers every aspect of management and focuses on supporting the performance management to achieve the objectives. <br> The management system should be subject to continuous improvement as the organization learns.
            
          <br>  Elements may include:
            <ul>
            <li>Leadership Involvement & Responsibility</li> 
            <li>Identification & Compliance with Legislation & Industry Standards</li> 
            <li> Employee Selection, Placement & Competency Assurance</li>
            <li> Workforce Involvement</li>
            <li>Communication with Stakeholders (others peripherally impacted by operations)</li>
            <li> Identification & Assessment of potential failures & other hazards</li>
            <li>Documentation, Records & Knowledge Management</li> 
            <li> Documented Procedures</li>
            <li> Project Monitoring, Status and Handover</li>
            <li>Management of Interfaces</li> 
            <li>Standards & Practices</li> 
            <li>Management of Change & Project Management/li>

        <h2>What is a Management System?</h2>
        <p>Management Systems are systematic frameworks designed to manage an organization's policies, procedures and processes and promote continual improvement within.   
            The implementation of a proven and effective Management System, such as ISO 9001 Quality Certification, can help a business to improve operations, manage risk and promote stakeholder confidence. 

        <h2>What can management systems do for you?</h2>
            Research shows that businesses that adopt and certify to best practice, as outlined in internationally-recognized standards, reap substantial benefits:
            <ul>
                <li>75% experienced improved customer service</li>
                <li>77% boosted their performance</li>
                <li>074% acquired new customers and retained existing clients</li>
                <li>achieved cost savings</li>
                <li> do organizations obtain management system certification</li>
                <li> business has three basic challenges that threaten their success:</li> 
            </ul>
           <P> Comply with customer requirements and government regulations and standards
                Protect the organization through embedding quality and instituting best practices
                Grow the organization, extending the customer reach and satisfaction, thereby increasing revenue 
                Management systems allow organizations to meet these challenges by instilling best practices and validating, through certification, that they are properly established in the company.</P>
